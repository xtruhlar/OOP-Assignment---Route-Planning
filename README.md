# OOP Assignment - Travel Route Planning with TatrasPlaner

Travel routes can be complex undertakings that greatly benefit from software support. They often involve detours to visit interesting places near the main route, with various services and events available at these locations. Recommendations for these places can be based on the traveler's needs and constraints. During the journey, the original plan may change, and group travel may involve synchronizing detours. Whether the travel plan is created by a professional or the travelers themselves, it can be valuable to share with others.

## Project Overview

### TatrasPlaner
TatrasPlaner is a valuable companion for every tourist exploring high-mountain areas. Users can customize the type of route they're looking for, specify their equipment, and indicate their physical condition. Based on these preferences, TatrasPlaner provides a detailed excursion plan.

TatrasPlaner includes a comprehensive list of hiking trails in the High Tatras, along with all cottages, hotels, and refreshment stops. It also provides detailed information about each trail, such as the starting point, end stop, elevation gain, terrain, and the estimated time spent on the trail. The project carefully considers the difficulty of each trail, ensuring users are directed to a route suitable for their physical condition and equipment.

The project offers various accommodation options based on the user's financial capabilities, including hotel options, private accommodations, or mountain huts. It also takes into account the total time the user plans to spend in the Tatras, whether it's a day trip, a weekend getaway, or a week-long stay.

Our goal is to provide users with a comprehensive experience while visiting the Tatras. TatrasPlaner aims to offer the best advice for planning routes and accommodations, ensuring that the visit to this beautiful region of Slovakia is unforgettable.
